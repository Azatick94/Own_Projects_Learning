# Biodiversity-project
Codeacademy Introduction to Data Analysis course. Capstone project

In this project I analyzed the data, which was provided by National Park Service. 
I used pandas, matplotlib, scipy libraries for this work. 

I imported data, analysed provided data, constructed different plots and histograms, used different statistical tools etc. 
Finally, these tools helped me to detect endangered species from different National Parks. 

The main results:
1) Mammals are more likely to be endangered than Reptiles. 
2) Scientist are studying the sheep in the different parks and they are interested in sheep's disease descrease. I have estimated number of sheep in each park and how many weeks do scientiests need to observe sheep in Bryce & Yellowstone parks. 
3) These results can be used for further analysis of another endangered species or for bigger amount of parks.
