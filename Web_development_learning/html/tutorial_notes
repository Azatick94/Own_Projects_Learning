##Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

##Block level elements in HTML:
Example: address, article

##Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
Example: a, label, button etc.

##The <div> Element
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.


##Using The id Attribute
The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document).

##Difference Between Class and ID
An HTML element can only have one unique id that belongs to that single element, while a class name can be used by multiple elements
